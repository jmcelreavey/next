## Lily Pad

A LilyPad is a floating component that is rendered as a modal. They can be free floating, draggable or anchored to another element on the page. They are a good choice for components like context menus.

### Anchoring LilyPads

When given an `anchorElement` the LilyPad will be positioned relatively to the anchorElement. The LilyPad has two position props `anchorOrigin` and `panelOrigin` to control which corner or edge of each is connected to the other. Typically an anchorOrigin of `BottomLeft` is combined with a panelOrigin of `TopLeft` for a context menu type situation.

### Triggering LilyPads

Most LilyPad components stay closed until some other UI interaction triggers them. You can see an example of how to do this in the [AnchoredLilyPad story]()

To make this simpler however you can use the [TriggeredLilyPad]() which provides state management and a simpler API for rendering the trigger element.
