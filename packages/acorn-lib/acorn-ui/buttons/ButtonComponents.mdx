# Buttons

A button is any component that can be clicked on to perform an action. Buttons are used
to submit forms and trigger important actions.

## Button components

Use the following components when creating buttons:

### Button

Use the Morse `<Button>` component rather than the native `<button>`. This is simply a
styled variant but one which also understands onClick handlers that return promises
which will put the button into a busy state and prevent the user from "double clicking"

<Canvas>
  <Button
    onClick={() =>
      slowly(() => {
        alert("done after 3 seconds");
      }, 3000)
    }
  >
    Click me
  </Button>
</Canvas>

Consult the [Morse docs](https://gcdtech.gitlab.io/morse/storybook/?path=/story/morse-react-components-button--simple-button)
for more information on the supported styling props of `Button`

### Buttons

Use the Morse `<Buttons>` component to layout out closely related buttons that might live as a family.

<Canvas>
  <Buttons>
    <Button>Archive</Button>
    <Button>Delete</Button>
    <Button>Report</Button>
  </Buttons>
</Canvas>

for more information on the supported styling props of `Buttons`

### ButtonLink

If you only want to navigate to destination using the router, consider using the `<ButtonLink>` component instead
of attaching an onClick to a `<Button>`. This will ensure that the button is rendered as an `<a>` tag and will
therefore be more accessible.

<Canvas>
  <ButtonLink href="/">Go Home</ButtonLink>
</Canvas>

> Note that generally most navigation links should appear as standard links. Buttons normally trigger an action
> rather than navigate. There are notable exceptions to this rule however. For example users are very familiar
> with a Cancel button on a form, especially when used in a dialog. However this can normally be implemented as
> by simply navigating back to the previous page.
>
> Always consider if a ButtonLink is masking a different question we should ask of our design - should we
> just use a link?

### BackButton

BackButton implements a "back" navigation event. Depending on the situation, this is often the best
way to implement a cancel button as it will bring the user back to the exact state they were on before.
This becomes very important in CRUD forms where the user may have customised the filters and sorts of
the list and want to return to the correct place if they cancel.

### ButtonBar

Use the Morse `<ButtonBar>` component to surround buttons when those buttons naturally represent the possible actions
of a task. This can bar can then be targetted in stylesheets to position it appropriately.

<Canvas>
  <ButtonBar>
    <Button>Save</Button>
    <Button className="+ghost">Cancel</Button>
  </ButtonBar>
</Canvas>
