# Button Copy

When writing button copy try to very clear about the consequence of clicking the button.

Avoid using generic terms like "Cancel" when more specific terms like "Not Now" would be more helpful.
Try to enter the thought process of the user - when presented with the choice of which button
to use, what would be their natural fear or concern with pressing the button.

This can be especially important with confirmation buttons or destructive buttons. In other
words buttons that trigger state changes in the application should reiterate what the user
is about to do.

For example, instead of "Submit", it should be "Create Customer". Instead of "Yes" it should
be "Cancel Booking".
