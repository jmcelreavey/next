<Title>Form Layout in Acorn</Title>

## Working with Forms and Storybook

When developing forms you should continue to use the storybook first approach.
The two common component types you will create will be a `Form` component and
a `FieldSet` component.

### Form components

Form components should be complete independant forms that contain a valid form
tag and the buttons to submit the form. All behaviours should be supplied via
props and ideally the screen hosting the form would pair the form component with
a hook and spread the behaviours down.

This approach allows designers to rework a form while continuing to respect its
contract with the hosting page.

Form components should end in the `Form` suffix to make it clear that they are
self contained forms e.g. `BookingForm`.

### Fieldset components

If you've identified that parts of the form you are building should be reusable
in other forms, consider creating a FieldSet component. This represents a group
of fields that could be easily named - for example `ContactDetailsFieldset`.

Fieldset components should, as the name implies, wrap the inputs in an
Acorn `Fieldset` component which will ensure the `<fieldset>` tag is added to
aid accessibility.

Do not create components for use with more than one Fieldset. Experience has
shown that anything beyond a single Fieldset is less likely to be reused as the
chance of the specification of the second use case being different increases
greatly.

### Input layout

Inputs can be laid out quickly using the `<LabelledInput>` component. This
presents an input passed as child wrapped with a label and a validation
message if provided.

<LabelledInput errors={{ Firstname: { message: "Enter a firstname" } }}>
  <TextBoxInput name="Firstname" />
</LabelledInput>
