<Title>Form inputs in Acorn</Title>

Input components are any type of component that can take a value and present
a user interface to allow the user to modify that value.

While this obviously covers custom inputs Acorn also provides a suite of inputs
based upon native browser inputs. We do this for two reasons:

1. To ensure inputs support theming at the Morse, Acorn and Project level
2. To ensure inputs are noramlised in their behaviour to make them easier to
   swap, one for another.

Inputs designed for regular user end in the suffic 'Input' and we encourage this
naming in projects too.

All input components should accept the generic `SyntheticInputProps` which
provides concrete typing around the value of the input and provides a
`onValueChange` event prop. This ensures any native `onChange` prop is not
shadowed by customised behaviours.

> It is recommended to use Acorn inputs, and the onValueChange prop where
> possible. Adapters should be made to support form libraries.

## Native input wrappers

In some cases to acheive normalised support for `SyntheticInputProps` the
behaviour of an input must be modified substantially from the native type.

For example, the `type=checkbox` HTML input behaves quite differently from
other inputs. Its value prop sets the 'checked value'. When a form is submitted
if the checkbox is checked, this value will be emitted as the value of the
input, and if not checked the form omits this property.

When noramlised however we want this input to behave like the others, namely
that the value prop receives the current value of the input and the input
should be capable of representing both the checked and the unchecked states
as alternative values.

In cases like this you should expect to find a simpler component that only
adds theming support to allow you to tackle problems that require a more
native friendly approach. In the case of our checkbox example you can find
both a Checkbox component (native, themed) and a CheckboxInput (normalised,
synthetic).

## Input Library

### Text Inputs

#### TextBox

<TextBoxInput />

#### TextArea

<TextAreaInput rows={6} cols={50} />

### Boolean Inputs

#### Checkbox

The Checkbox input wraps a standard checkbox input and so unlike other inputs the value
prop refers to the value the input will present to form once checked.

<Checkbox />

#### CheckboxInput

CheckboxInput is a normalised and synthetic wrapper around Checkbox. It is most commonly
used to capture a simple boolean value, but both the checked and unchecked values
can be overridden with props.

<CheckboxInput />

### Selects

#### Select

Select is a simple themed version of a browser input.

<Select>
  <option>Option A</option>
  <option>Option B</option>
  <option>Option C</option>
</Select>

#### SelectInput

SelectInput is a native select that uses the options prop to provide the source of its
options to render.

<SelectInput options={() => ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]} />

The `options` prop is a powerful prop that can provide an array of values, an array of
OptionItem objects or a promise to return either of these.

#### SyntheticSelect

SyntheticSelect is a reproduction of a drop down select created using other native browser
elements. It allows for more consistent and sophisticated features such as results filtering
and custom rendering of options. It may not be as accessible or perform as well on touch
devices.

Unlike `Select` this variant is a controlled input and cannot track its own value. In this
demo therefore selecting a value appears to do nothing as you must attach both the value
and onValueChange props.

<SyntheticSelectInput options={() => ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]} />

#### ListBox

ListBox is a presentation component that allows you to show a scrollable list of options
for a user to pick from.

<Canvas>
  <ListBox>
    <ListBox.Body>
      <ListBox.Item>Option A</ListBox.Item>
      <ListBox.Item>Option B</ListBox.Item>
      <ListBox.Item>Option C</ListBox.Item>
    </ListBox.Body>
  </ListBox>
</Canvas>

#### ListBoxInput

ListBoxInput turns a ListBox into a controlled synthetic input with the expected
`value` and `onValueChange` props.

<Canvas>
  <ListBoxInput options={() => ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]} />
</Canvas>

### Search Inputs

Search inputs assume that no results are meaningful until the user has searched using a
text phrase.

#### Search

The `Search` component simple presents a text input wrapped in faux input container that
presents a search icon beside the input. It is not an input itself but simply wraps a
standard native text input.

<Search />

#### SearchInput

The `SearchInput` component is a `SyntheticSelectInput` that renders the trigger as a
searchable input. This input works in just the same way as the `SelectInput` but the
results are searchable. Note that in most cases a `SearchInput` will render complex
children for each item to better represent the search results. For that reason the
assumption has been made that the items in the search are also complex objects and
so there is no default filtering provided. Instead the `options` prop should always
be a callback function that can take the `phrase` string argument to return relevant
results.

<SearchInput
  options={() => {
    const options = ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"];
    return options.filter((item) => item.includes(phrase));
  }}
/>

### Inputs as a wider technique

Thinking with an input mindset can make some problems much easier to solve. For example
if you need to show multiple text inputs to capture a single value you would be best
to create an input component which wraps them. The internal inputs serve the purpose
of computing the value of the main input.

A great example of this is the `AddressInput`. It contains multiple text boxes but
it presents a single value as an Address object. This means the input can be easily
added to any form without knowing the inputs contained within it. Setting the value
to null or undefined can also be a nice way to put the complex input into a default
state.

Inputs that do use native browser inputs should have all of their props available
include `onChange`. This allows you to interact with DOM level events.
