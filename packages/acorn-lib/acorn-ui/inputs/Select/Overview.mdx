<Title>Select inputs in Acorn</Title>

Select inputs can be any type of input that allows users to select from a list of options.

The most familiar perhaps is the native `<select>` input in the browser, however also
consider radio groups, sets of checkboxes, listboxes and other more inventive
solutions.

Common to all select inputs is the concept of a list of possible options. Frequently these
need to be loaded from a datasource at run time, and sometimes can contain large numbers of
results that need to be filtered.

In Acorn we have solved this problem generally by the creation of a `useOptionsSource` hook.
It can translate one of a number of possible source types into a standardised array of
`OptionItem` objects for select inputs to consume.

> When building custom and unique selection inputs, try to recognise that it fits the
> pattern of a select input and use the `useOptionsSource` hook to provide the options.

## Notes on accessibility

Custom built select inputs are notoriously hard to make accessible. The native `<select>`
may be a better option despite its limitations. Consider carefully how your input will
work on a mobile device especially if your interface is targetted at that environment.

If you do build your own, please use hooks like `useHighlightedOption` and
`useListKeyboardNavigation` to provide the best experience for keyboard users.
