### Basic Timeline

The essential components are the `Timeline` component which is the container for one or more items, and the `TimelineItem` component which contains the content of a single entry. \<Timeline.Item> \<Timeline.ItemContent>

This happened

\</Timeline.ItemContent> \</Timeline.Item> \<Timeline.Item> \<Timeline.ItemContent>

As did this

\</Timeline.ItemContent> \</Timeline.Item>

```jsx
<Timeline>
  <Timeline.Item>
    <Timeline.ItemContent>
      <p>This happened</p>
    </Timeline.ItemContent>
  </Timeline.Item>
  <Timeline.Item>
    <Timeline.ItemContent>
      <p>As did this</p>
    </Timeline.ItemContent>
  </Timeline.Item>
</Timeline>
```

### Icons

For timelines with mixed sources of content it can be useful to indicate this with an icon. Use the `icon` prop on the `Timeline.Item` component and add the `icons` prop to the timeline itself.

A search was peformed

Something minor happened

The user had a conversation.

Notice that the `"blank"` icon name is reserved and injects a special element that signifies no icon at all. Useful when no icon is available or to indicate that an event is minor or automated etc.

The left hand margin that is normally used for icons can actually have other elements instead. However you should ensure there is a single parent and put the `ac-timeline__item-icon` on that parent to ensure it is positioned correctly.

This item has a checkbox instead of an icon as an 'icon'

The user sent an email.

### Item content

From these initial examples you can see that `Timeline.Item` and `Timeline.ItemContent` is very basic. They simply ensures that the position of content and icons are correct and allows the project stylesheet to style each part correctly.

The content inside `Timeline.ItemContent` is completely flexible.

There are some standard content components however.

#### Timeline.ItemContentEvent

A simple message about an occurring event.

The patent started pending.

#### Timeline.ItemContentNote

A note recorded by a user

The customer called to report a fault however we could not determine the cause. Due a call back by John.

#### Timeline.ItemContentCredit

The customer called to report a fault however we could not determine the cause. Due a call back by John. Called the customer however there was no answer

The message component formats a message, with an author and a date and time.
